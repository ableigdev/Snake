# Snake

This is a console snake game which has flexible architecture and can be easily modified and improved in the future. 

If you want to build this project, you must have a Visual Studio 2017.

I tested this game on my PC which has CPU Intel i5 7600 and also I tested on my laptop which has CPU Intel Pentium N3710.

In both cases, this game works very well.
